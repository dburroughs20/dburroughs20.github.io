#About Me
##My Interests
* Cars
 
I drive a Nissan 370z and love cars, **especially** cars from Japan. 
I enjoy working on my car and I enjoy going to car meets frequently.
 One thing that I love about my car is the Magma Red paint color.

* Videogames

 I like to play videogames in my free time.
I have a gaming laptop and many game consoles such as a ps5, Xbox 360, and Xbox one.
Some of my favorite videogames are Halo 3, Destiny, and Ninja Gaiden.

* Exercise
 
 I enjoy any sort of exercise and try to incorporate it into my daily routine whether its walking my dog, walking at work, or lifting weights at the gym.
 I like lifting weights the most because its satisfying seeing muscle growth and it makes me feel good overall.
